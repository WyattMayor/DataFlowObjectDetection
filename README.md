# DataFlowObjectDetection
Term Project for Comp 444 UIUC
The main idea of this project is to collect human traffic flow using object detection. The goal of this project is to train YoLo on two datasets CoCo and Fisheye Security Camera Dataset. Using human detection the program will extract userful information like how long a person is in the view, when a person enters the view, and when a person leaves the view.
